### 💅 Changed
- Settings: reorganize the panel into user-oriented groups for display/fonts, canvas/windows, AI assistants, tasks/shortcuts, worker connections, integrations, and advanced tools while preserving search and legacy section routing. (#266)
- Worker: Desktop now versions local-worker reuse and repairs legacy connection files before reconnecting, preventing installed upgrades from reusing stale runtimes and bypassing persistence repair. (#264)
- Support: expand in-app issue reports into structured redacted diagnostic bundles with runtime state, process snapshots, and log excerpts. (#262)
- Workspace canvas: simplify Space creation and scoped lifecycle operations so the same `Create Space` action creates child Spaces inside existing Spaces, child Spaces can become Space Worktrees under the ancestor-chain guard, and archive cleanup is explicit for contained Worktrees. (#257)
- Workspace canvas: note markdown export now defaults to Downloads, confirms the save location on Desktop, supports WebUI browser downloads, and reports completion through the app message toast instead of inline note status text. (#253)
- Space Explorer: now opens at half the canonical agent window width by default, uses flatter VS Code-style selection chrome, and creates new files/folders inline in the tree with preserved selection. (#232)
- Workspace canvas: document nodes now use a Monaco editor with live disk refresh, dirty/conflict protection, and dark-theme fixes. (#233)
- Workspace canvas: note-style inline title editing now also applies to terminal, agent terminal, and task nodes, with text-only edit hit areas, drag-safe blank headers, placeholder titles, and long-title rendering fixes. (#226)
- Workspace canvas: double-clicking the minimap now recenters the viewport on the target region without changing the current zoom level. (#222)
- UI: project sidebar agent lists are now collapsible with task-first single-line rows, provider icons, inline title editing, and synced color accents. (#205)
- Worker: packaged Desktop is now local-only for Home Worker, auto-repairs legacy standalone/remote configs on launch, recovers cleanly if local-worker startup fails, and boots the packaged local worker without Electron-only runtime imports. (#162)
- Worker: packaged Desktop now uses Local Worker mode, auto-repairs legacy standalone/remote configs on launch, recovers cleanly if local-worker startup fails, and boots the packaged local worker without Electron-only runtime imports. (#162, #195)
- Settings: allow auto-focus to center within the visible canvas (accounts for the primary sidebar). (#166)
- Workspace canvas: context menus now stay near the pointer, only flip on real overflow, and reorder note/space actions for faster access. (#64)
- What's New: switched update notes from runtime GitHub compare fetching to release-manifest delivery embedded in each build. (#67)
- Workspace canvas: keep Arrange By menu open while tweaking options (dismiss on outside click). (#42)
- Workspace canvas: arrange spaces before root nodes during canvas/global arrange. (#42)
- Workspace canvas: default arrange now keeps standard-size alignment always on and resizes spaces to the fitted tiled result. (#42)
- Workspace canvas: tiled arrange now keeps an idea lane first, can open that lane into two note columns when space allows, then places task + linked agent groups before standalone agents / terminals. (#42)
- Workspace canvas: dense packing now favors balanced aspect ratios over ultra-tall stacks for more shelf-like results. (#42)
- Workspace canvas: drag now previews live snap guides continuously and only commits magnetic snapping on release for steadier pointer movement. (#42)
- Workspace canvas: show drag-surface overlays only for multi-select (Shift+click/marquee) and treat mixed selection with Spaces as space-dominant drag. (#82)
- Workspace canvas: Arrange By now simplifies Space sizing to `Tighten Space` / `Keep Space size`, defaults to `Tighten Space`, and moves magnetic snapping to the top-level context menu. (#42)
- Worker Web UI: now opt-in via Settings (and supports an optional fixed port). (#161)
- Settings: default UI theme is now dark. (#69)
- Shortcuts: Yield app shortcuts to the terminal when it’s focused (configurable), and allow customizing keybindings in Settings → Shortcuts. (#59)
- Shortcuts: unify app and workspace-canvas keybindings under single-bind customization, make canvas shortcuts recordable, and switch Command Center to Cmd/Ctrl+P by default. (#68)
- Simplified GitHub PR integration to a link-only chip (removed in-canvas PR panel/actions/diff/checks UI for now).
- UI: Softened minimap node colors in light theme. (#47)
- UI: Made modal dialogs opaque for clearer readability. (#48)
- Spaces: dragging Terminal/Agent windows across directory-bound spaces now shows a compact confirmation, then moves with `DIR MISMATCH` labeling. (#51)
- Spaces: allow empty Spaces (no last-node warning/auto-close), add pane context menu action to create an empty Space, and allow archiving a Space without saving its history. (#171)

### 🐞 Fixed
- Space Explorer: make image quick previews match the opened image node size and keep preview headers from covering image content. (#287)
- Dev: keep the launching terminal interactive after stopping `pnpm dev` with Ctrl+C by making the dev wrapper own child-process shutdown. (#286)
- Workspace canvas: reduce CPU usage during rapid multi-window dragging by keeping live drag projection canvas-local, throttling multi-node drag publishing, and removing unnecessary React Flow handle measurement. (#285)
- Workspace canvas: keep Space Worktrees bound to their worktree directory after creating terminal or agent nodes, and preserve archive/status access through approved worktree roots. (#284)
- Persistence: reject accidental empty workspace overwrites unless the caller explicitly opts in, preventing sync/restart from clearing durable workspace state. (#265)
- Persistence: harden installed upgrade repair, block stale local Worker reuse across app-version changes, and document rollback as unsupported unless explicitly tested. (#261)
- Worker/PTY: shutdown-time IPC disconnects no longer crash the process with unhandled `EPIPE` / closed-channel errors. (#260)
- Remote: fix Managed SSH localhost-to-WSL startup by preserving OpenSSH argument ordering, allocating dedicated worker ports, and waiting for the remote worker to become ready before marking the endpoint connected. (#259)
- Remote agents: preserve the worker command `PATH` when launch env overrides `PATH`, so WSL Codex starts instead of failing with `execvp(3) failed`. (#259)
- Workspace canvas: keep Child Spaces contained during window resize by expanding child/ancestor Spaces together and moving Space subtrees as one push-away group. (#257)
- Workspace canvas: fix note Markdown download activation and move note save, convert-to-task, and label-color actions into the note header menu. (#253)
- Agent: launch interactive agent CLIs through terminal profiles instead of host PATH preflight, so agent runtime environments match OpenCove terminals and Windows host diagnostics no longer block valid launches. (#250)
- Workspace canvas: block nodes at Child Space edges until the drag pointer enters the child, preventing pre-entry overlap and ownership drift. (#245)
- Workspace canvas: browser download panels now merge live runtime download events with persisted records, so in-progress and incognito downloads stay visible before persistence catches up. (#246)
- Mounts: route generic Space-based agent/terminal launches through the resolved mount, repair stale Space bindings, and keep node-control space resolution aligned with the same mount-aware context rules. (#241)
- Remote: harden managed SSH endpoint lifecycle coverage, make repair actions respect manual vs managed authority, and verify remote-only project browse via fake SSH E2E. (#240)
- Desktop: upgrade Electron to 41.5.1 and queue website-window snapshot requests until the runtime is ready, preventing dropped captures during activation/loading transitions. (#238)
- Agent: unify external CLI command environment ownership so GUI/Desktop launches resolve shebang-based Node CLIs consistently across availability, model listing, launch/resume, session discovery, task title generation, and worktree naming. (#236)
- Terminal: reduce multi-terminal output jank by globally pacing xterm writes and throttling committed screen-cache serialization. (#231)
- Space Explorer: clamp the window to the visible canvas viewport so shorter inactive macOS windows no longer overflow the canvas. (#232)
- Agent: macOS PTY host now self-heals `spawn-helper` execute permission so `run_agent` launches do not fail. (#233)
- Agent recovery: task-launched Claude Code sessions now persist and restore correctly from `.opencove/worktrees/...` paths in installed Windows builds. (#228)
- Workspace canvas: guard transient detached terminal renderer sync during task drag so dragging nodes no longer crashes the renderer. (#224)
- Windows agents: restore native Codex/Claude/OpenCode launch and restart recovery, stabilize task-launched Claude restore, and keep OpenCode WebGL terminal content aligned without stale side residue. (#221)
- Terminal: make automatic display-consistency shared reference match manual capture under canvas zoom, and defer zoom-time DPR settle to reduce intermittent terminal content size twitching. (#218)
- Workspace canvas: preserve trackpad canvas wheel ownership across idle hover gaps until explicit pointer retargeting, so terminals no longer steal the next two-finger canvas pan after a brief pause. (#219)
- Agent: centralize local executable resolution with per-provider overrides so provider availability, model listing, hydrate/resume, and launch stay consistent across GUI-launched shell environments. (#210)
- Workspace approval: auto-register persisted workspace roots during startup so restored workspaces keep terminal, agent, and guarded file operations working even if `approved-workspaces.json` is missing or stale. (#210)
- Space Explorer: image files now support quick preview and image-node opening in mount-targeted Spaces and browser control-surface paths. (#203)
- Terminal: preserve magnifier-like zoom geometry while restoring settled post-zoom clarity, so DPR refresh no longer doubles the visible terminal scale or clips content. (#187)
- Terminal: restore post-zoom clarity after viewport settle without requiring a return to bottom, while preserving live scroll/focus semantics. (#186)
- Terminal recovery: unblock Desktop first paint while worker runtime prepare continues, keep restored agent input interactive across `Cmd+W` reopen and cold restart, and preserve inactive workspace terminal output for later restore. (#191)
- Windows terminal rendering: keep 125% DPI embedded terminals crisp, preserve OpenCode WebGL in manual PowerShell terminals, and snap the retained WebGL path onto the device-pixel grid. (#148)
- Recovery: restored agent windows now keep durable restart history visible, reattach to fresh runtime sessions after full app restart, remain interactive for stdin, and preserve OpenCode embedded theme sync in the restored runtime path. (#172)
- OpenCode: Stabilized embedded terminal rendering and cursor hit-testing to eliminate shutter-like artifacts and cursor flicker in restored canvas sessions. (#144)
- OpenCode: Embedded agent terminals now follow OpenCove UI theme and re-theme reliably when switching light/dark. (#155)
- Crash recovery: recover from renderer and child-process failures with a localized error boundary and lifecycle logging to prevent silent white screens. (#137)
- Website window: keep embedded pages clipped inside canvas nodes during zoom/occlusion, preserve stable 100% page scale, and route in-page/new-window navigation back into OpenCove. (#141)
- Startup + shortcuts: avoid non-packaged locale hydration stalls and stabilize `Cmd/Ctrl+G` space creation when selected terminal nodes are involved. (#141)
- Startup: unblock project restore from terminal scrollback hydration, show a dedicated loading screen during workspace restore, and replace the blank startup flash with a polished loading transition. (#215)
- Terminal: Added Linux terminal-node shortcuts for `Ctrl+Shift+C` copy and `Ctrl+Shift+V` paste while preserving plain `Ctrl+C` as `SIGINT`. (#142)
- Agent windows now inherit terminal profile runtime/env semantics during launch, recovery, and fallback; Windows raw-TUI wheel handling is covered by regression tests. (#110)
- UI: unified shared menu overlays to fix prompt template, task session, and related context-menu offset issues. (#121)
- Persistence: Repair cumulative SQLite schema upgrades and auto-heal mis-versioned local databases so workspace state saves no longer fail after upgrading from older installs. (#76)
- Spaces: New windows created from a crowded space now preserve existing window layout, expand the space only as needed, and keep the viewport centered on the final position. (#62)
- Settings: update status now summarizes updater feed parsing errors instead of dumping raw parser/CSP output. (#67)
- macOS: Disable in-app update checks for unsigned/ad-hoc builds and show actionable guidance instead of failing code signature validation. (#128)
- Workspace canvas: fix pane context menu rendering regression and harden right-click coordinates. (#42)
- Workspace canvas: align collision normalization with the 24px snap grid to avoid post-drag drift. (#42)
- Workspace canvas: clamp live snap-guide overlays to the viewport so vertical guides no longer trigger canvas scrollbars while dragging. (#42)
- Workspace canvas: note-to-task conversion now resizes to the standard task size and pushes away overlapping nodes. (#63)
- Workspace canvas: keep push-away projection live during drag while sync refreshes apply. (#133)
- Prevented canvas zoom/pan when scrolling inside overlay windows.
- Codex: Fixed agents getting stuck on `working` and missing standby notifications when switching projects or after restart. (#81)
- Restored packaged terminal rendering by allowing xterm's required inline style channels in production and ignoring invalid cached terminal dimensions during hydration.
- Terminal: Hydrate UTF-8 locale for GUI-launched terminals on macOS/Linux and enable Wayland IME integration on Linux. (#65)
- Terminal: Preserve shell history arrow keys after terminal restore by avoiding stale xterm mode replay. (#65)
- Windows: Fixed double header / mismatched chrome by switching to hidden title bar + titlebar overlay and syncing overlay theme with app theme. (#47)
- Windows: Fixed native select dropdown styling issues (notably dark mode) by using a custom select component across the UI. (#47)
- Terminal: Fixed theme glitches when switching light/dark by syncing xterm theme with CSS tokens and reacting to theme change events. (#47)
- OpenCode: Keep embedded agent terminals pinned to dark theme to avoid partial light/dark desynchronization. (#60)
- Canvas: Stabilized auto input-mode detection to default to mouse semantics until high-confidence trackpad gestures are observed. (#47)
- Worktree window: Fixed light theme text colors in the create/archive dialog. (#47)
- Worktree archive: keep archiving the active Space from triggering an automatic global Fit View jump. (#217)
- Worktree create: Detect repos without commits and show an actionable error instead of failing to create the worktree. (#120)
- Worktree create: Branch dropdown no longer jumps to the top while scrolling. (#126)
- Task: Typing in the Task Name input no longer collapses Advanced Settings. (#48)
- Improved canvas drag smoothness under heavy terminal output by throttling terminal screen writes during viewport interaction while keeping output live. (#50)
- Normalized node resize and terminal selection drags while the canvas is zoomed. (#56)
- Stabilized and optimized space-bounded push-away reflow during node dragging to prevent edge overlaps/stacking. (#57)
- Workspace canvas: arrange is now aspect-aware, avoids large empty gaps, and auto-fits the viewport after arranging; created-time ordering is deterministic across node types. (#72)
- Workspace canvas: arrange-in-space now focuses the space bounds and caps zoom at the configured focus target zoom. (#131)
- Terminal: Prevented `node-pty` native aborts from crashing the whole app by isolating PTY into a utility process. (#75)
- Terminal: Prevented terminal/agent nodes from clipping the last row/column and showing a black gutter around the embedded terminal. (#150)
- Spaces: Fixed Space pills truncating and made worktree branch/PR chips refresh without switching projects. (#129)
